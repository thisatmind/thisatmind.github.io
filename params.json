In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Patrick Shim (@festinalente91), sangwoo jeon(@jeonsangwoo)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support]\r\n(thisatmind.support@gmail.com) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
